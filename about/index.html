                                            Hi, my name is Alex. I am currently a computer science student studying at the University of Toronto: Scarborough. 
                                            I have been coding since I was 13 years old. Over the years I have completed numerous projects using various technologies including Java, C, C# and HTML/CSS/JavaScript 
                                            to name a few. Some I am more proud of than others but from every project I have always taken away something that I have used in later projects to continue making 
                                            them better than the last. I am a passionate and self-motivated person who absolutely loves to learn new technologies through school and extracurricular sources. 
                                            I have spent countless hours on academic sources such as Udemy and numerous technical books in my ever-persisting endeavors to learn new things.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="about-page__paragraph">
                                            Alongside my love for computer science I also enjoy producing electronic music as a hobby.
